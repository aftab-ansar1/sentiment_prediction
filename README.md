The app is designed to help to understand the machine of the emotion expressed in the review of a product or text input of the user

The text input need not be a product review but since, the model is trained on the product review data, it works more accurate with the same kind of information

The model interprets the emotions as Positive, Negative and Neutral.

The emotions interpreted by the model need not to be accurate due to the limitation of the training data and machine learning capability.

The interpretations may be affected by the complexity of the sentences, tone, satire, irony, context or references to some historical or classical events/entities.

App is created using tensorflow sequential model with GloVe embedding.  

User descretion is expected while using this app.
